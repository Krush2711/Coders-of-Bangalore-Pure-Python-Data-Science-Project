# Coders-of-Bangalore-Pure-Python-Data-Science-Project
A complete end-to-end data parsing and analysis project built using 100% pure Python, without relying on external data science libraries. This project demonstrates how to collect raw data, structure it, parse it manually, and extract meaningful insights using only core Python.

# Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing coder activity in Bangalore using raw text-based data.
You will build your own parser and logic to extract insights such as:

Top contributors by posts

Most-followed coders

Category-based coder rankings

Combined metrics analysis

Final summary reports

The workflow is inspired by a 6-lesson project:
